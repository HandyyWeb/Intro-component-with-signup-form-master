Built with 

- Semantic HTML
- CSS media queries + CSS font-face rules
- Javascript DOM manipulation ( style object, ocument object, etc...)

# <ins> What I learned <ins>

Hello, it's has been a long time since my previous challenge. In fact I haven't had the time to work on frontend challenges due to personal things.
So there are 2 big concepts that I have learnt/ gone deeper into:

- Firstly, this project is my first project using Javascript to manipulate HTML DOM, and I think I did pretty well even though it is very far from good, I need to get used to using Javascript and the good habits that come with it, I have learned to use: document object, style object, template literals.

- Secondly, I have really deepened how to make form, use form, style form, etc... ; it's not perfect ( for example there is no `<label>` element ) but now I have a better understanding of how is form works.

# <ins> Continued development <ins>

But the challenge is <ins> far from complete <ins>:

- I'm sure my javascript code can be improved, for example using event handlers instead of a single function, using less variables, etc...

- My CSS can also be improved, there are little problems like a big empty space below my `text` element, I fixed it once but it came back after another (maybe a problem of `margin` or, I don't know to be honest), the placeholder text in the email input is also not red like it should be.

- I'm not really sure if a `<label>' element is really needed, maybe some small changes in my HTML code too.

https://web.dev/learn/forms/ : As for me, it's one of the best website if you want to learn all that is need to be know for creating form

https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_document.asp : As always, w3schools is very useful and handy if you need some tips for Javascript, and other subjects too, try it !
